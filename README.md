Ergonomic bindings for [nanomsg next generation] \(nng), in Python.
pynng provides a nice interface on top of the full power of nng.  nng, and
therefore pynng, make it easy to communicate between processes on a single
computer or computers across a network.  This library is compatible with Python
≥ 3.10.  nng is the [rewriting](https://nanomsg.github.io/nng/RATIONALE.html) of
[Nanomsg](https://nanomsg.org/), which is the spiritual successor to [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/).

Goals
-----

Provide a Pythonic, works-out-of-the box library on Windows and Unix-y
platforms.  Like nng itself, the license is MIT, so it can be used without
restriction.

Installation
------------

On Windows, MacOS, and Linux, the usual

    pip3 install pynng

should suffice.  Note that on 32-bit Linux and on macOS no binary distributions
are available, so [CMake](https://cmake.org/) is also required.

Building from the GitHub repo works as well, natch:

    git clone https://github.com/codypiersall/pynng
    cd pynng
    uv pip install -e '.[dev]'

pynng might work on the BSDs as well.  Who knows!

Using pynng
-----------

Using pynng is easy peasy:

```python
from pynng import Pair0

s1 = Pair0()
s1.listen('tcp://127.0.0.1:54321')
s2 = Pair0()
s2.dial('tcp://127.0.0.1:54321')
s1.send(b'Well hello there')
print(s2.recv())
s1.close()
s2.close()
```

Since pynng sockets support setting most parameters in the socket's `__init__`
method and is a context manager, the above code can be written much shorter:

```python
from pynng import Pair0

with Pair0(listen='tcp://127.0.0.1:54321') as s1, \
        Pair0(dial='tcp://127.0.0.1:54321') as s2:
    s1.send(b'Well hello there')
    print(s2.recv())
```

### Using pynng with an async framework

Asynchronous sending also works with

[trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
[asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).  Here is an example
using trio:


```python
import pynng
import trio

async def send_and_recv(sender, receiver, message):
    await sender.asend(message)
    return await receiver.arecv()

with pynng.Pair0(listen='tcp://127.0.0.1:54321') as s1, \
        pynng.Pair0(dial='tcp://127.0.0.1:54321') as s2:
    received = trio.run(send_and_recv, s1, s2, b'hello there old pal!')
    assert received == b'hello there old pal!'
```

Many other protocols are available as well:

* `Pair0`: one-to-one, bidirectional communication.
* `Pair1`: one-to-one, bidirectional communication, but also supporting
  polyamorous sockets
* `Pub0`, `Sub0`: publish/subscribe sockets.
* `Surveyor0`, `Respondent0`: Broadcast a survey to respondents, e.g. to find
  out what services are available.
* `Req0`, `Rep0`: request/response pattern.
* `Push0`, `Pull0`: Aggregate messages from multiple sources and load balance
  among many destinations.

Examples
--------

Some examples (okay, just two examples) are available in the
[examples](https://github.com/codypiersall/pynng/tree/master/examples)
directory.

Troubleshooting
---------------

### macOS: `ld: archive member '/' not a mach-o file`

This error occurs when Homebrew LLVM's `llvm-ranlib` is used instead of Apple's
native `ranlib`. The `llvm-ranlib` tool has a
[known bug](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/98997) where it produces
GNU archive format instead of BSD/Darwin format for static libraries with no
exported symbols. Apple's linker rejects these archives.

pynng's build system detects and works around this automatically. If you still
encounter this error, you can explicitly set the ranlib tool:

    CMAKE_RANLIB=/usr/bin/ranlib pip install pynng

Or pass it through scikit-build-core:

    pip install pynng -C cmake.args="-DCMAKE_RANLIB=/usr/bin/ranlib"

### Linux: `libclang` not found

pynng requires `libclang` development headers to parse NNG's C headers at build
time. Install the appropriate package for your distribution:

    # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt install libclang-dev

    # RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
    sudo yum install clang-devel

    # Alpine
    apk add clang-dev

Git Branch Policy
-----------------

The **only** stable branch is `master`.  There will *never* be a `git push -f`
on master.  On the other hand, all other branches are not considered stable;
they may be deleted, rebased, force-pushed, and any other manner of funky
business.
