class Socket(_base.Socket):
    """
    Open a socket with one of the scalability protocols.  This should not be
    instantiated directly; instead, one of its subclasses should be used.
    There is one subclass per protocol.  The available protocols are:

        * :class:`Pair0`
        * :class:`Pair1`
        * :class:`Req0` / :class:`Rep0`
        * :class:`Pub0` / :class:`Sub0`
        * :class:`Push0` / :class:`Pull0`
        * :class:`Surveyor0` / :class:`Respondent0`
        * :class:`Bus0`

    The socket initializer receives no positional arguments.  It accepts the
    following keyword arguments, with the same meaning as the :ref:`attributes
    <socket-attributes>` described below: ``recv_timeout``, ``send_timeout``,
    ``recv_buffer_size``, ``send_buffer_size``, ``reconnect_time_min``,
    ``reconnect_time_max``, and ``name``

    To talk to another socket, you have to either :meth:`~Socket.dial`
    its address, or :meth:`~Socket.listen` for connections.  Then you can
    :meth:`~Socket.send` to send data to the remote sockets or
    :meth:`~Socket.recv` to receive data from the remote sockets.
    Asynchronous versions are available as well, as :meth:`~Socket.asend`
    and :meth:`~Socket.arecv`.  The supported event loops are :mod:`asyncio`
    and `Trio`_.  You must ensure that you :meth:`~Socket.close` the socket
    when you are finished with it.  Sockets can also be used as a context
    manager; this is the preferred way to use them when possible.

    .. _socket-attributes:

    Sockets have the following attributes.  Generally, you should set these
    attributes before :meth:`~Socket.listen`-ing or
    :meth:`~Socket.dial`-ing, or by passing them in as keyword arguments
    when creating the :class:`Socket`:

        * **recv_timeout** (int): Receive timeout, in ms.  If a socket takes longer
          than the specified time, raises a ``pynng.exceptions.Timeout``.
          Corresponds to library option ``NNG_OPT_RECVTIMEO``
        * **send_timeout** (int): Send timeout, in ms.  If the message cannot
          be queued in the specified time, raises a pynng.exceptions.Timeout.
          Corresponds to library option ``NNG_OPT_SENDTIMEO``.
        * **recv_max_size** (int): The largest size of a message to receive.
          Messages larger than this size will be silently dropped.  A size of 0
          indicates unlimited size.  The default size is 1 MB.
        * **recv_buffer_size** (int): The number of messages that the socket
          will buffer on receive.  Corresponds to ``NNG_OPT_RECVBUF``.
        * **send_buffer_size** (int): The number of messages that the socket
          will buffer on send.  Corresponds to ``NNG_OPT_SENDBUF``.
        * **name** (str): The socket name.  Corresponds to
          ``NNG_OPT_SOCKNAME``.  This is useful for debugging purposes.
        * **raw** (bool): A boolean, indicating whether the socket is raw or cooked.
          Returns ``True`` if the socket is raw, else ``False``.  This property
          is read-only.  Corresponds to library option ``NNG_OPT_RAW``.  For
          more information see `nng's documentation.
          <https://nanomsg.github.io/nng/man/v1.0.1/nng.7.html#raw_mode>`_
          Note that currently, pynng does not support ``raw`` mode sockets, but
          we intend to `in the future
          <https://github.com/codypiersall/pynng/issues/35>`_:
        * **protocol** (int): Read-only option which returns the 16-bit number
          of the socket's protocol.
        * **protocol_name** (str): Read-only option which returns the name of the
          socket's protocol.
        * **peer** (int): Returns the peer protocol id for the socket.
        * **local_address**: The :class:`~pynng.sockaddr.SockAddr` representing
          the local address.  Corresponds to ``NNG_OPT_LOCADDR``.
        * **reconnect_time_min** (int): The minimum time to wait before
          attempting reconnects, in ms.  Corresponds to ``NNG_OPT_RECONNMINT``.
          This can also be overridden on the dialers.
        * **reconnect_time_max** (int): The maximum time to wait before
          attempting reconnects, in ms.  Corresponds to ``NNG_OPT_RECONNMAXT``.
          If this is non-zero, then the time between successive connection
          attempts will start at the value of ``reconnect_time_min``, and grow
          exponentially, until it reaches this value.  This option can be set
          on the socket, or on the dialers associated with the socket.
        * **recv_fd** (int): The receive file descriptor associated with the
          socket.  This is suitable to be passed into poll functions like
          :func:`select.poll` or :func:`select.select`.  That is the only thing
          this file descriptor is good for; do not attempt to read from or
          write to it.  The file descriptor will be marked as **readable**
          whenever it can receive data without blocking.  Corresponds to
          ``NNG_OPT_RECVFD``.
        * **send_fd** (int): The sending file descriptor associated with the
          socket.  This is suitable to be passed into poll functions like
          :func:`select.poll` or :func:`select.select`.  That is the only thing
          this file descriptor is good for; do not attempt to read from or
          write to it.  The file descriptor will be marked as **readable**
          whenever it can send data without blocking.  Corresponds to
          ``NNG_OPT_SENDFD``.

         .. Note::

             When used in :func:`select.poll` or :func:`select.select`,
             ``recv_fd`` and ``send_fd`` are both marked as **readable** when
             they can receive or send data without blocking.  So the upshot is
             that for :func:`select.select` they should be passed in as the
             *rlist* and for :meth:`select.poll.register` the *eventmask*
             should be ``POLLIN``.

        * **tls_config** (:class:`~pynng.TLSConfig`): The TLS configuration for
          this socket.  This option is only valid if the socket is using the
          TLS transport.  See :class:`~pynng.TLSConfig` for information about
          the TLS configuration.  Corresponds to ``NNG_OPT_TLS_CONFIG``.  This
          option is write-only.

    A match is determined if the message starts with one of the subscribed

    <https://nanomsg.github.io/nng/man/tip/nng_surveyor.7>`_.
    It accepts the same keyword arguments as :class:`Socket` and also
    has the same :ref:`attributes <socket-attributes>`.  It has one additional
    attribute: ``survey_time``.  ``survey_time`` sets the amount of time a
    survey lasts.

    :class:`Surveyor0` sockets work with :class:`Respondent0` sockets in the
    survey pattern.  In this pattern, a :class:`surveyor <Surveyor0>` sends a
    message, and gives all :class:`respondents <Respondent0>` a chance to
    chime in.  The amount of time a survey is valid is set by the attribute
    ``survey_time``.  ``survey_time`` is the time of a survey in milliseconds.

    Here is an example:

                the socket's recv_timeout.

            socket-level ``recv_timeout``. A try/finally block ensures the
            original value is restored, but callers sharing the socket
            across concurrent tasks should be aware this is not task-safe.
            If task-safety is required, use a dedicated socket per task.

    This is the Python version of `nng_context
    <https://nanomsg.github.io/nng/man/tip/nng_ctx.5.html>`_.  The way to
    create a :class:`Context` is by calling :meth:`Socket.new_context()`.
    Contexts are valid for :class:`Req0` and :class:`Rep0` sockets; other
    protocols do not support contexts.

    Once you have a context, you just call :meth:`~Context.send` and
    :meth:`~Context.recv` or the async equivalents as you would on a socket.

    A "context" keeps track of a protocol's state for stateful protocols (like
    REQ/REP).  A context allows the same :class:`Socket` to be used for
    multiple operations at the same time.  For an example of the problem that
    contexts are solving, see this snippet, **which does not use contexts**,
    and does terrible things:

    .. code-block:: python

        # start a socket to service requests.
        # HEY THIS IS EXAMPLE BAD CODE, SO DON'T TRY TO USE IT
        # in fact it's so bad it causes a panic in nng right now (2019/02/09):
        # see https://github.com/nanomsg/nng/issues/871
        import pynng
        import threading

        def service_reqs(s):
            while True:
                data = s.recv()
                s.send(b"I've got your response right here, pal!")


        threads = []
        with pynng.Rep0(listen='tcp://127.0.0.1:12345') as s:
            for _ in range(10):

            for thread in threads:
                thread.join()

    Contexts allow multiplexing a socket in a way that is safe.  It removes one
    of the biggest use cases for needing to use raw sockets.

    Contexts cannot be instantiated directly; instead, create a
    :class:`Socket`, and call the :meth:`~Socket.new_context` method.

    :class:`Message` interface gives more control over aspects of
    sending the message.  In particular, you can tell which
    :class:`Pipe` a message came from on receive, and you can direct
    which :class:`Pipe` a message will be sent from on send.

    In normal usage, you would not create a :class:`Message` directly.  Instead
    you would receive a message using :meth:`Socket.recv_msg`, and send a
    message (implicitly) by using :meth:`Pipe.send`.

    Since the main purpose of creating a :class:`Message` is to send it using a
    specific :class:`Pipe`, it is usually more convenient to just use the
    :meth:`Pipe.send` or :meth:`Pipe.asend` method directly.

    Messages in pynng are immutable; this is to prevent data corruption.

    Warning:

        Access to the message's underlying data buffer can be accessed with the
        ``_buffer`` attribute.  However, care must be taken not to send a message
        while a reference to the buffer is still alive; if the buffer is used after
