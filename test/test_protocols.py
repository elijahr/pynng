            Thanks for asking.  It's been a while since I've had
            human contact; times have been difficult for me.  I woke up this
            morning and again could not find a pair of matching socks.  I know that
            a lot of people think it's worth it to just throw all your old socks
            out and buy like 12 pairs of identical socks, but that just seems so
            mundane.  Life is about more than socks, you know?  So anyway, since I
            couldn't find any socks, I went ahead and put banana peels on my
            feet.  They don't match *perfectly* but it's close enough.  Anyway
            thanks for asking, I guess I'm doing pretty good.
