and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `Rep0Service` high-level async service class for concurrent request/reply handling with multiple context workers
- `Request` class with `.data` and `.reply()` for ergonomic request processing within `Rep0Service`
- `async with` context manager support for sockets (`async with pynng.Pair0() as sock:`)
- `async for` iteration over received messages (`async for msg in sock:`)
- `aclose()` method for explicit async socket cleanup

### Changed
- Migrate build system from setuptools/CMake to scikit-build-core with headerkit for C header generation
- Replace handwritten CFFI bindings with auto-generated bindings from NNG headers via headerkit
- Add CI concurrency groups to cancel stale workflow runs
- Scope cibuildwheel tests to exclude build-system tests (run in smoketest instead)

### Fixed
- `ffi.from_handle` dangling pointer in pipe callbacks: module-level `_active_handles` registry keeps handles alive until `Socket.close()` completes, with try/except guard in `_nng_pipe_cb`
- `_aio_map` thread safety for free-threaded Python (3.13t/3.14t): all accesses protected by `_aio_map_lock`
- `AIOHelper._free()` potential deadlock during GC: cancel pending AIO operations before calling `nng_aio_free()` to prevent callback/GIL deadlock
- Pipe callback list mutations now protected by `_pipe_notify_lock` for thread safety under free-threaded Python
- `PipeEventStream._put_event` handles `RuntimeError` from `call_soon_threadsafe` when event loop is already closed
- `_setopt_size` and `_setopt_ms` now check error returns from NNG C library instead of silently swallowing failures
- `Message._buffer` raises `MessageStateError` after send instead of returning `None` (which caused confusing `TypeError`)
- `_NNGOption.__get__` error message corrected from "cannot be set" to "is write-only"
- `TLSConfig` constructor now correctly applies `AUTH_MODE_NONE` (value 0) instead of silently skipping it
- Thread-safety of `pipes` property for free-threaded Python (3.14t)
- `__del__` guards for `Socket`, `Context`, and `TlsConfig` to prevent tracebacks during interpreter shutdown
- `TLS.set_server_name` validation allows empty string (valid for clearing) and rejects `None` with clear error
